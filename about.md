Hi everyone! My name is Connor Escajeda and I am in CSCI 340 Databases and Web Systems. This summer I had an internship where I worked on a professional program that was a website with a massive database so this class is going to be a great opportunity to expand on what I learned this summer and to fully understand what I was doing. When I am not doing class or homework you will usually find me running track or cross country and then when all of that isn't taking my time I like to spend it with all of my friends!
