For my final project so far I have taken a role in helping setting our deadlines and organizing who needs to do what work. I typically also manage the email communication with our client and set up our meetings with him. In the second client meeting I helped explain our thoughts and why we made our mock up the way that we did. I also helped dig out some more information from him about what specifically he was wanting from us and got in to the nitty gritty of what this website is going to really be for him. My plans for how I am going to assist my team is by continuing to keep my team on task and having deadlines in mind and of course working on creating the actual Razor Page and working on the style of how the website is going to look.
