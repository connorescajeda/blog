 Almost all of this lab was pretty new to me and I had a lot of weird random issues that I had to troubleshoot and find solutions to but isn't that the beauty of computer science? I struggled a lot with getting certain things to show up on my website which was really annoying because I didn't know why it wasn't showing and had to spend time researching and understanding Jekyll which is a good thing because I've learned a lot. I think most of everything makes sense now but I won't really know what I don't know until I dive deeper into it and find out that I don't know what I am doing. I am looking forward to fleshing out this website more and more, and hoping in the coming weeks I get a little bit more free time to be able to make something neat out of it.

 Some of the resources that made this fun endeavor possible were [Jekyll Themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) and [Front Matter Help](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/).
