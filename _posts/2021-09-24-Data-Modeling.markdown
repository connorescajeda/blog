This lab wasn't my favorite personally. I did enjoy it once I got to use Vertabelo but having to do the first entity relationship drawing felt very tedious and annoying. Which I do know this is tedious work and how important it is to lay a good framework for a database but it just doesn't seem to be my cup of tea. The crows feet were also some what confusing to me, I think I got them right for the most part but there were parts that still just didn't quite make sense to me. I am pretty happy with how I got my data to look even if it probably isn't the best way to model it. It was a lot of work for me to think through what goes to what and how to connect some of the relationships. I think there are a few complications my models could encounter and it would come down to starting and finalizing orders. I think I may be missing some stuff there or I could just be overthinking it but I feel like there should have been something else there with that. Quick note, I did change a few connections from my entity diagram to the Vertabelo. Overall, this lab was somewhat challenging but a super cool experience to see what it requires of people to make a very lasting and efficient database. Below are my two diagrams!
